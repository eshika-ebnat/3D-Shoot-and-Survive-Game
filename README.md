Title Of the Game: Shoot and Survive

Objective:
In this 3D Survive and Shoot game  the player moves around the map using WASD and jumps with Space to evade enemies. Armed with weapons, the player can shoot (mouse left), reload (R), and throw grenades (G) to survive incoming waves. New weapons can be collected through pickups, and enemies continuously spawn and chase the player, becoming stronger with each wave. A scoring system tracks performance, while health, ammo, and power-ups determine survival. The game can be paused (P), reset (N), or viewed in first-person or third-person mode (F). When defeated, a Game Over screen appears, marking the end of the run
